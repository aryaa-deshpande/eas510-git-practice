I’m a graduate student at UB studying Artificial Intelligence. In the past year I’ve worked on projects like building resume screening tools, retrieval systems for documents, and some computer vision pipelines.  

What interests me now is learning the basics properly. I’d like to apply what I learn to healthtech and mental health, where technology can actually make a difference for people.
